    THIS IS A MANUAL, PLEASE READ BEFORE PROGRAMMING AUTONOMOUS
    Use MoveForward() MoveBack() TurnLeft() and TurnRight() to move the robot easier. 
    Inside the parentheses input the amount of time (in seconds) you want the robot 
    to move or turn in the respective direction. You also need to put in the amount of
    volts that will go to the motors when the function is called. 

    For MoveForward() there is a parameter that allows you to use the vacuum whilst you move.
    Input either True or False into this area to say if the Vacuum should move.

    There is also VacuumSpin() and FlywheelSpin() which VaccumSpin() only has time as a 
    parameter, whilst FlywheelSPin has both the time and the volts.

    There is also OpticalChecker(), which is the roller spinner. I could defo change the name.
    It has no parameters but is currently not able to use

    Also, StringStart() and StringEnd() have no parameters and dont have any wait functions,
    so you can make it drop the string while moving the robot. 

    ShootDisk() moves all of the conveyor motors as well as the Flywheels, its used as a general
    function when you want to have the disks to shoot.
    It only uses one parameter, which is the amount of time you want the motors to move.

    RotateForward() and RotateReverse() are functions that take in a number and a list for the
    all of the motors you want to rotate in the respective direction of the function.
    The number that you input is the amount of seconds you want those motors to rotate.

    Zero volts does nothing and 12 volts go the fastest that the motor can move

    The fuctions should be like this:

    MoveForward([the amount of seconds you want], [volts from 0 - 12], [If you would like]
                                                                [the vacuum to go while moving]) 
    MoveBack([seconds], [volts]) 
    TurnLeft([seconds], [volts])
    TurnRight([seconds], [volts])
    VacuumSpin([seconds], [volts], [direction])
    FlywheelSpin([seconds], [volts])
    OpticalChecker()
    StringStart()
    StringEnd()
    ShootDisk([seconds])
    RotateForward([seconds], [list of motors])
    RotateReverse([seconds], [list of motors])

    Note that autonomous is only 15 seconds, so be mindfull of how much time you spend using the functions
